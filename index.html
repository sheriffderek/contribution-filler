This Frontend Masters Ember course is not very enlightening. I think that ES6 is fantastic, but it seems pretty rude to assume that everyone is up to date - and not to even introduce the new syntax.

Ember docs need a more inclusive 'what you should know before you begin' area.

model() { return true } seems more special and mysterious than it should.

Desctructuing seems expecially trolly when teaching someone.
