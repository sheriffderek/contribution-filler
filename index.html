This is a test to see if someone could fill their contribution chart up to look like they were doing tons of important work on github. I'm going to write a tweet like sentence every day ( replacing the current code ) and see what happens. I'm not planing on it, but I may have to get a job at an established business and - most of my work is done in private beanstalk repos - and therefor I don't look nearly as busy as I am. This is mostly just for fun. I don't think I would want to work for someone who could be tricked by this - but I would likely enjoy working for someone who thought this was a funny experiment.
